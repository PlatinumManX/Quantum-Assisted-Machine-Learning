# Quantum-Assisted-Machine-Learning
This project provides an interactive Streamlit application that compares the performance of a Classical SVM and a Quantum SVM implemented using PennyLane. It demonstrates how quantum kernel-based classification performs against traditional machine learning techniques on small datasets under simulated quantum constraints.
